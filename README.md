Sharing my .zshrc file with custom functions and configs. 
If you choose to use this file as your own, you need to 
place it in your home directory(~) named as .zshrc instead 
of it's current zshrc.txt

Some plugins and items in this file need to also be 
installed before adding or you;ll run into problems. So I 
recommend looking for them with your package manager and 
installing. At the end of installation it should give you a 
line of code that says...
 "source /path/to/whatever/you/just/added" 
 As you can see multiple of those at the top of my file.

One of the most useful things you will find here are the 
functions and aliases. That is the reason I share this file 
because people can easily add those to their own .zshrc 
file and get the same functionality from their shell. I 
have modify wordlist functions, formatting proxies for 
proxychains, all types of special Mac networking options 
that you probably didn't know were possible on M1 and more. 
Check it out, take what you please, and thank you for 
visiting this page!
